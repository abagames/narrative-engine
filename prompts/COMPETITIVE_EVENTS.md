```

#### Participation Decision Matrix
```typescript
eventValue =
  skillMatchLevel * 0.3 +
  potentialRewards * 0.25 +
  reputationGain * 0.2 +
  networkingOpportunity * 0.15 +
  (10 - competitionLevel) * 0.1;

resourceCost =
  participationFee +
  opportunityCost +
  preparationTime +
  riskLevel;

netValue = eventValue - (resourceCost * 0.8);

// 7.0+ = Must Participate, 5.0-6.9 = Conditional, < 5.0 = Skip Participation
```

### 2. Pre-Competition Strategy

#### Preparation Phase Framework
```markdown

- Competing participants research
- Rules & conditions detailed confirmation
- Judging criteria understanding

**Capability Assessment**
- Own party strengths analysis
- Weakness identification & countermeasures

```

#### Competition Readiness Score
```typescript
readinessScore =
  skillPreparation * 0.35 +
  resourcesSecured * 0.25 +
  informationQuality * 0.2 +
  supportNetwork * 0.15 +
  mentalReadiness * 0.05;

if (readinessScore >= 8.5) ‚Üí Confident victory participation
else if (readinessScore >= 7.0) ‚Üí Aggressive participation
else if (readinessScore >= 5.5) ‚Üí Cautious participation
else ‚Üí Consider postponement or withdrawal
```

### 3. Competition Execution Strategy

#### Real-Time Decision Making
```markdown
**Treasure Hunt Tactics**
- Initial Route: High probability areas priority vs competitor avoidance
- Information Use: Known information utilization vs new exploration
- Risk Management: Safe & certain vs high risk high return
- Competitor Response: Cooperation possibility vs interference countermeasures

**Trading Competition Tactics**
- Market Selection: Stable markets vs volatile markets
- Product Strategy: High volume trading vs high added value
- Timing: Early entry vs post-market observation
- Information War: Information disclosure vs concealment strategy

**Exploration Race Tactics**
- Route Strategy: Shortest distance vs safe route
- Pace Distribution: Full sprint vs endurance battle
- Obstacle Response: Detour vs breakthrough
- Cooperation Decision: Accompanying vs solo action

**Craft Fair Tactics**
- Work Strategy: Technology focus vs design focus
- Presentation: Detailed explanation vs impression focus
- Judging Response: Regulation compliance vs creativity display
- Time Management: Completion priority vs within-time finish
```

#### Adaptive Strategy Framework
```typescript
competitionStrategy = adaptToSituation({
  currentPosition: leaderboardRanking,
  timeRemaining: remainingDuration,
  competitorActions: observedBehaviors,
  resourceStatus: currentResources,
  unexpectedEvents: emergentFactors
});

if (currentPosition <= 3 && timeRemaining < 30%) ‚Üí Defensive strategy
else if (currentPosition > 5 && timeRemaining > 50%) ‚Üí Offensive strategy
else if (unexpectedEvents.severity > 7) ‚Üí Adaptive strategy
else ‚Üí Plan adherence strategy
```

### 4. Competition Performance Optimization

#### Mid-Competition Adjustments
```markdown
**Leading Position**
- Strategy: Safe measures to protect lead

- Actions: Creative approaches, concentration maintenance
- Goal: Enter top 3

**Behind Position**
- Strategy: High risk high return decisive moves
- Caution: Avoid reckless actions
- Actions: Innovative methods, differentiation from others
- Goal: Significant ranking improvement

**Last Resort**
- Strategy: Honorable withdrawal or desperate comeback
- Caution: Minimize reputation damage
- Actions: Utilize as learning opportunity
- Goal: Experience accumulation for next time
```

#### Performance Monitoring System
```typescript
performanceMetrics = trackProgress({
  objectiveCompletion: taskCompletionRate,
  efficiencyRatio: resourceUtilization,
  qualityScore: outputQuality,
  competitivePosition: currentRanking,
  timeManagement: scheduleAdherence
});

performanceScore =
  objectiveCompletion * 0.4 +
  qualityScore * 0.3 +
  efficiencyRatio * 0.2 +
  timeManagement * 0.1;

if (performanceScore < expectedScore * 0.8) ‚Üí Strategy review needed
```

#### Return on Investment Analysis
```typescript
competitionROI = calculateReturn({
  directRewards: monetaryGains + materialGains,
  reputationValue: reputationIncrease * marketValue,
  networkingBenefits: newConnections * relationshipValue,
  skillDevelopment: skillImprovement * trainingCostEquivalent,
  futureOpportunities: accessGained * opportunityValue
});

totalInvestment = participationCost + opportunityCost + preparationCost;
netROI = (competitionROI - totalInvestment) / totalInvestment;

// ROI > 50% = Great Success, 20-50% = Success, 0-20% = Break-even, < 0% = Loss
```
