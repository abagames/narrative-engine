```
Step 2.5: NPC Personality Application

1. Check NPC personality type
2. Reference corresponding behavioral traits
3. Generate choices from tactical patterns
4. Calculate modifier values using personality-specific evaluation formulas
5. Determine action based on final score
```

### Dynamic Personality Changes

```
Changes through Experience:
- Consecutive successes â†’ Aggressiveness +1, Intelligence +1
- Consecutive failures â†’ Aggressiveness -1, Caution +1
- Ally death â†’ Loyalty change, Aggressiveness change
- Continued disadvantage â†’ Intelligence +1, Aggressiveness adjustment

Change Limits: Â±3 points (prevents extreme changes)
```

### Interactions Between Multiple NPCs

```
Compatibility System:
- Aggressive + Cautious = Balanced coordination
- Cunning + Aggressive = High risk, high return
- Heroic + Any = Other NPCs' loyalty +1
- Chaotic + Any = Unpredictable coordination

Influence Range: NPCs within adjacent tiles
```

## ðŸ“Š Measuring Personality System Effectiveness

### Diversity Metrics

- Reduction in consecutive identical actions (Target: Less than 3 times)
- Distribution of tactical pattern usage
- Decrease in player prediction accuracy

### Narrative Effects

- Memorability of NPC characters
- Combat tension level
- Narrative unpredictability

---

This personality system enables each NPC to maintain consistent personality while achieving rich tactical diversity that dynamically changes according to situations.
