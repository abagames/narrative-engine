# Individual Combat System - Individual Combat System Framework

**Purpose**: Perform detailed combat processing at the individual party member level and completely record sword and magic interactions.

## üó°Ô∏è Party Member Combat Definition

### Basic Combat Profile
```typescript
interface CombatMember {
  id: string;                    // "iron_wolves.kael", "silk_merchants.zara"
  name: string;                  // "Kael the Bold", "Zara Shadowblade"
  class: 'Fighter' | 'Wizard' | 'Rogue' | 'Cleric';
  level: number;                 // 1-10

  // Combat Status
  hp: { current: number; max: number };
  stats: {
    attack: number;              // Physical attack power (1-20)
    defense: number;             // Physical defense power (1-20)
    magic: number;               // Magic attack power (1-20)
    resistance: number;          // Magic resistance (1-20)
    speed: number;               // Action order (1-20)
    accuracy: number;            // Hit rate (1-20)
  };

  // Equipment
  equipment: {
    weapon: CombatWeapon;
    armor: CombatArmor;
    accessories?: CombatAccessory[];
  };

  // Combat Skills
  skills: CombatSkill[];

  // Combat Conditions
  conditions: StatusCondition[];  // Poison, charm, enhancement, etc.
  actionPoints: number;          // Action points for that turn
}
```

### Weapon and Armor System
```typescript
interface CombatWeapon {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  type: 'sword' | 'bow' | 'staff' | 'dagger';
  damage: { min: number; max: number };
  accuracy_bonus: number;
  special_effects?: WeaponEffect[];
  narrative_prefix: string;      // "enchanted blade", "crackling staff"
}

interface CombatArmor {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  type: 'heavy' | 'medium' | 'light' | 'robes';
  defense_bonus: number;
  resistance_bonus: number;
  special_effects?: ArmorEffect[];
}

interface CombatSkill {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  type: 'attack' | 'spell' | 'support' | 'defensive';
  cost: { actionPoints?: number; mana?: number };
  effects: SkillEffect[];
  cooldown?: number;
  narrative_template: string;    // "casts {spell_name}, conjuring {effect}"
}
```

## ‚öîÔ∏è Combat Turn System

### Turn Structure
```
Phase 1: Initiative Determination
- Sort by each member's speed value
- Random order for equal speeds

Phase 2: Individual Action Execution
- Each member selects actions in turn
- Apply tactical patterns from TACTICAL_PATTERNS.md
- Decision making with GM_CORE_MIND.md / PLAYER_MIND.md

Phase 3: Simultaneous Effect Resolution
- Apply damage
- Process status conditions
- Combat end determination
```

### Action Selection Process
```
1. Extract Available Actions
   - Normal attack (always available)
   - Skill usage (cost and cooldown check)
   - Movement (tactical positioning)
   - Defense and waiting

2. Apply TACTICAL_PATTERNS.md
   - Select optimal pattern for current situation
   - Modify based on personality and class traits
   - Risk-return evaluation

3. Final Action Decision
   - Calculate pattern evaluation values
   - Weight by character personality
   - Add 5% random element
```

## üéØ Combat Action Detailed Processing

### Physical Attack Processing
```typescript
interface PhysicalAttack {
  attacker: CombatMember;
  target: CombatMember;
  weapon: CombatWeapon;

  // Calculation Results
  hit_chance: number;            // (attacker.accuracy + weapon.accuracy_bonus) vs target.defense
  damage_roll: number;           // weapon.damage + attacker.attack
  final_damage: number;          // damage_roll - target.defense
  critical_hit: boolean;         // 5% chance for 2x damage

  // Narrative Generation
  narrative: string;             // "Kael swings his enchanted blade..."
  dialogue?: string;             // Generated from DIALOGUE_SYSTEM.md
}
```

### Magic Attack Processing
```typescript
interface MagicAttack {
  caster: CombatMember;
  targets: CombatMember[];       // Single/area attack
  spell: CombatSkill;

  // Calculation Results
  cast_success: number;          // Casting success rate
  spell_power: number;           // caster.magic + spell.power
  damage_per_target: number[];   // Damage to each target
  additional_effects: SkillEffect[]; // Status conditions, etc.

  // Narrative Generation
  incantation?: string;          // "Ancient flames, heed my call!"
  visual_effect: string;         // "crackling fireball streaks"
  impact_description: string;    // "explodes in brilliant flames"
}
```

This framework allows converting abstract `conflict` actions into **true sword and magic combat** and completely recording each character's personality and tactical judgment.
