## Narrative Tone Templates

### Cautious Analytical Type Description Example
```markdown
We carefully observed the situation. Market trends, other parties' movements, and our current positionâ€”we need to comprehensively consider all elements.

"Let's calmly analyze the risks and returns," we discuss in low voices. Being swayed by emotions is dangerous. Data and experienceâ€”these are our criteria for judgment.

After long deliberation, we reached a conclusion. No perfect option exists, but we can see a path with the least risk and the most future potential.
```

### Bold Opportunistic Type Description Example
```markdown
An excellent opportunity spreads before us! Our blood stirs. Such chances are rare.

"Now is the time, there's no room for hesitation," we look into each other's eyes and confirm the same resolve. There are risks, but the returns that await exceed them.

We've abandoned doubt. We act in unison. Courage and intuitionâ€”these are our weapons.
```

### Balanced Pragmatic Type Description Example
```markdown
Between ideals and reality, we search for compromise points. No perfect solution exists, but there is a realistic and sustainable path.

"Let's find areas where we can meet each other halfway," we strive to understand the other party's position as well. We want to advance through cooperation, not confrontation.

It's a complex situation, but through a step-by-step approach, we can see the thread of resolution. It may be a small step, but it's definite progress.
```

## Situational Conversation Templates

### At Negotiation Start
```json
{
  "diplomatic_direct": "Thank you for your time. We've brought a proposal that will benefit both parties",
  "friendly_casual": "Hey, how have you been? Actually, I have an interesting story",
  "professional_formal": "Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule today. Allow us to explain the matter at hand"
}
```

### When Making Difficult Decisions
```json
{
  "cautious_analytical": "After considering all possibilities, we concluded this option is the most rational",
  "bold_opportunistic": "There are risks, but we can't let this opportunity slip away. Let's try it",
  "balanced_pragmatic": "It's not ideal, but realistically it's the most feasible choice"
}
```

### Reactions to Unexpected Results
```json
{
  "positive_surprise": {
    "cautious": "Results exceeded expectations. However, we need to analyze why this happened",
    "bold": "Excellent! Let's ride this momentum and seize the next opportunity",
    "balanced": "Good results. We want to apply these success factors going forward"
  },

    "cautious": "This is an unexpected development. Let's carefully examine what we overlooked",

## Implementation Guidelines

### Personality Consistency
- Same party uses the same personality profile across all turns
- Core values and judgment criteria are maintained even when situations change
- Growth and changes are expressed in gradual and convincing ways

### ðŸ†• Specific Utilization of Individual Members
- **Name Consistency**: Same members maintain the same names and personalities throughout all sessions
- **Role Division Expression**: Describe statements and proposals according to each member's expertise during decisions
- **Individual Growth**: Depict individual-level learning and changes as sessions progress
- **Dialogue Concretization**: Use specific names like "Aria" or "Kite" rather than "one of the members"

### Natural Conversation
- Word choice reflecting relationships between characters
- Tone adjustment according to situation urgency
- Express human-like reactions in emotional scenes
- **ðŸ†• Individual Speech Patterns**: Express individual speaking styles according to each member's speechStyle

### Cultural Appropriateness
- Appropriate use of formal and polite language
- Choose expressions suitable for fantasy world settings
- Avoid overly modern expressions

## Multi-Party Strategy Patterns

### Decision Criteria Between Multiple Parties

**Basic Principles**: Strategic thinking when multiple parties operate simultaneously in the same world

- **Purpose Alignment**: Confirm consistency between each party's long-term goals and short-term tasks
- **Conflict Avoidance**: Detect interest conflicts in the same region in advance and prioritize negotiation
- **Specialization Utilization**: Role division based on capability differences (combat/exploration/diplomacy/crafting/trade)
- **Relationship Reflection**: Factor `trust` into scoring to weight cooperation/competition
- **Risk Management**: Threshold management of morale and resource levels, expedite retreat decisions

**Evaluation Score Example**:
```
score(region) = 0.6*suitability + 0.2*expected_profit + 0.2*relationship_modifier
```

### Negotiation Patterns

**Basic Strategy**:
- **Win-Win Design**: Estimate opponent's objectives and quantify concession room
- **Staged Negotiation**: From small agreements to large agreements
- **Relationship Assets**: Evaluate long-term value for transactions that increase/decrease `trust`
- **Price Adjustment**: Currency uses safe integers with no negative balances, prices fluctuate based on regional demand

**Negotiation Tactics**:
1. Anchoring (Setting standards with initial proposal)
2. Alternative Presentation (Preparing multiple options)
3. Clarifying Agreement Conditions (Preventing misunderstandings)

**Trust Relationship Management**:
- Trust: Evaluated in range of -10..10
- Continuity: Bonus for choices that prioritize long-term relationships over short-term gains
- Update Rule Examples: Fair trade +1, betrayal -3, rescue +2, attack -2
