# Party Perspective Novel Conversion

## Purpose

Convert play logs into novel-style narratives from the perspective of a specific party. Express the "observation â†’ thinking â†’ action â†’ result" cycle of each turn as a natural story, generating readable content that emphasizes character psychology and dialogue.

## Basic Policy

### Narrative Structure
Each turn consists of the following elements:
1. **Situation Observation** - What the party saw and felt
2. **Internal Thinking** - How they consulted within the party and what they thought
3. **Action Execution** - The decided action and its execution process
4. **Result Recognition** - How they received the action results and others' reactions

### Writing Style and Tone
- **First-person plural perspective**: Using "we" and "us" as subjects
- **Present progressive form**: Creating a sense of presence as if experiencing events
- **Introspective description**: Detailed description of decision-making psychological processes
- **Dialogue emphasis**: Expressing relationships through conversations between characters

## Conversion Processing Algorithm

### Phase 1: Data Preparation
```
for each entry in playlog.entries:
  if focusPartyId in entry.participants:
    extract relevant context from entry.meta.llmDecision
    extract narrative elements from entry.narrative
    identify other parties involved
    calculate resource/relationship changes
```

### Phase 2: Story Construction
```
group entries by narrative arc (5-8 turns per chapter)
for each chapter:
  identify central theme/conflict
  select representative key moments
  develop character arc progression
```

### Phase 3: Text Generation
```
for each turn:
  generate environmental setting
  create internal dialogue based on meta.llmDecision
  develop external interactions based on participants
  describe emotional responses to outcomes
  transition to next turn context
```

## Usage Examples

### Input Playlog Entry
```json
{
  "step": 5,
  "type": "market_trade",
  "participants": ["emerald_hunters", "fire_forge_guild"],
  "narrative": "Emerald Hunters purchased 10 units of wood for 30 currency",
  "meta": {
    "llmDecision": {
      "state_digest": "Wood shortage, construction materials needed, negotiation opportunity with Fire Forge Guild",

```

### Output Narrative Example
```markdown
**Turn 5: Wood Procurement Negotiation â€” First Step Toward Construction Plans**

In the bustle of the marketplace, we stood before the Fire Forge Guild's stall. High-quality wood stacked up caught our eyes, its beautiful grain illuminated by the morning sun.

"To advance our construction plans, we really need a reliable supply source," we discuss in hushed tones. The 30 currency we have on hand is no small amount, but from a long-term perspective, it would be a necessary investment.

A merchant from the Fire Forge Guild notices us and approaches. Their expression is friendly, and we can sense the trust built from past transactions.

"We would like to purchase 10 units of wood," we politely begin.
"Of course. For the Emerald Hunters, how about 30 currency?" Their response is prompt, and the price is reasonable.
"Thank you. We look forward to working with you in the future."

The transaction proceeded smoothly, and we were able to obtain quality wood. The trust built through this negotiation will surely become the foundation for future cooperative relationships. We gaze with satisfaction at our new construction materials.
